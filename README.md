 CICS 191: First Year Seminar -- Math Puzzles.
 My favorite in class puzzle was the Star Rats puzzle, where each letter in STAR and RATS represented a number, and 4*STAR=RATS, and the same letter always represented the same number.
 My favorite out of class puzzles are sudoku puzzles, where there are nine squares in a 9x9 box, and each line and 3x3 square has to have one of each number. I like these because I've done them enough to have an efficient strategy.
